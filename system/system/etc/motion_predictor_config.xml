       As the model is trained stochastically, there is some expected minimum
       variability in its output. This can be a UX issue when the input device
       is moving slowly and the variability is large relative to the magnitude
       of the motion. In these cases, it is better to inhibit the prediction,
       rather than show noisy predictions (and there is little benefit to
       prediction anyway).

       The value for this parameter should at least be close to the maximum
       predicted distance when the input device is held stationary (i.e. the
       expected minimum variability), and perhaps a little larger to capture
       the UX issue mentioned above.
